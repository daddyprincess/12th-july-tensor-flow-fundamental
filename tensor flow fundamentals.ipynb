    "    Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~Scalar (0-D tensor): tf.constant(42)\n",
    "    ~Vector (1-D tensor): tf.constant([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "    ~Matrix (2-D tensor): tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n",

    "2.Variables: TensorFlow variables are used to store mutable state, such as model parameters. They are often used for\n",
